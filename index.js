// - Must be closed in the correct order 
// - Should have a corresponding opening bracket of the same type

// Question 2

// time and must return to the end of the line (which happens instantly) to purchase additional tickets.
// If a person has no more tickets to buy, he or she will leave the line. 
// Return the time spent for the individual atâ€¯position k (0-indexed) to 
// finish buying tickets.

// Question 3

// You are given an array heights representing the heights of students in a 
// class. The students are standing in a line, and their heights are listed 
// in the order they appear from left to right. The school wants to arrange 
// the students in a non-decreasing order by their heights. However, when they 
// rearrange the students, a few may end up in different positions from their original positions.

// You need to write a function heightChecker(heights) that determines the 
// minimum number of students who are not standing in the correct positions 
// after the rearrangement. Implement the function heightChecker and return the 
// minimum number of students who are not positioned correctly.

// Example: 

// Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
// Output: 3



function heightChecker(heights) {
    incorrectPosition = 0 
    const sortedHeights = ([...heights].sort((a,b) => a - b ))   //sort heights

                                                                    
    for (let i = 0; i < heights.length; i ++) {                  //iterate through each height in the array
        if (heights[i] !== sortedHeights[i]){                    //if original array height is not equal to sorted height
            incorrectPosition++                                  //increment incorrectPosition

// Question 4
// You are given a deck of integer arrays. There is a deck of cards with each card having 
// a unique integer, and the integer on the ith card is deck[i].  
// You can arrange the deck in any order; all cards in one deck are initially face-down (unrevealed).  
// Repeat the following steps until all cards are revealed.  
// Step 1: Take out the top card from the deck and reveal it. 
// Step 2: If there are still cards in the deck, you should place the next top card at the bottom of the deck. 
// Step 3: If any cards remain unseen, return to step 1. Otherwise, proceed to the end. 
// Step 4: Return a deck order that reveals the cards in increasing order. 


function deck(integers) {
    const revealedCards = [];

    // Iterate through each deck
    for (let i = 0; i < integers.length; i++) {
        // Check if the deck is not empty before attempting to reveal a card
        if (integers[i].length > 0) {
            // Take out the top card and reveal it
            revealedCards.push(integers[i][0]);
